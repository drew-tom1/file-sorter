## Project Description

Created a mini file-sorter that sifted through my Downloads folder on my desktop and mapped it to different folders for organization. I built it as a refresher on Python and it has some fluff to it.

I was a bit picky with how my files were sorted so I mapped them to different folders individually but can easily redo the script to run on anyone's computer, make it a bit more efficient.
